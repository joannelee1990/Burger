# Burger

### Details on the assignment
This is the creation of a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Why use handlebars?

* Handlebars is one of the most advanced (pre-compiling and the like), feature-rich, and popular of all the JavaScript templating engines, and it has the most active community.

* Handlebars is a logic-less templating engine, which means there is little to no logic in your templates that are on the HTML page. The most important use of Handlebars, and any templating engine, is to keep your HTML pages simple and clean and decoupled from the logic-based JavaScript files, and Handlebars serves this purpose well. Indeed, Dust.js is also a logic-less templating engine and a worthy alternative to Handlebars.js.

* Moreover, the cutting-edge JavaScript frameworks Meteor.js and Derby.js, which we will cover in upcoming posts, are expected to become mainstream in the coming months, and both use Handlebars.js. To be clear: Meteor.js uses Handlebars.js and Derby.js “template syntax is largely based on Handlebars” template syntax. And Ember.js uses Handlebars, too.
While Backbone.js is packaged with Underscore.js templating engine, it is super easy to use Handlebars.js with Backbone.js.

### Ending Notes

There were many examples of similar projects found on Github, Stack Overflow, W3 Schools, the Firebase website which you could use as reference. However just googling certain parts that you are stuck on help as well. (Google Fu!) Also, turning to your classmates helps a great deal. I learned that just by talking it out with classmates, often times you are able to answer your questions yourself!

Make your burger and devour it!
